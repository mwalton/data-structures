NAME
     cmatch -- print matching lines from files

SYNOPSIS
     cmatch [-iln] string [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     cmatch searches the named input files for lines containing the
     string.  By default the matching lines are printed.  If more than
     one file is specified, lines of output are preceded by the
     filename.

OPTIONS
     Options are scanned using getopt(3) and are subject to its
     restrictions and conventions.

     -i   Ignore case distinctions between the string and the contents
          of files.

     -l   Suppress normal output.  Print only the names of files for
          which a match is found.

     -n   Prefix each line of output with the line number starting
          from 1 within each file.

OPERANDS
     The first operand is required and is the string to be used to
     search the files.  The rest of the operands are filenames to be
     processed in sequence.  If no filenames are specified, stdin is
     read.  If a file is specified as a single minus (-) stdin is read
     at that point.

EXIT STATUS

     0    No errors were detected.

     1    Errors were detected and messages printed to stderr, either
          for invalid options or inaccessible files.
