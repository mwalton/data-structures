NAME
     jxref -- cross referencing and word count utility

SYNOPSIS
     jxref [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     Each file is read in sequence and words are extracted from the
     file.  At the end of each file, a table is printed, sorted in
     lexicographic order with each word followed by a count of the
     number of times it occurs and a list of the numbers of the lines
     where it occurs.  Cross reference output is written to stdout
     (System.out) and error messages are written to stderr (System.
     err).

OPTIONS
     None.

OPERANDS
     Operands consist of the names of files to be read in sequence.
     If no filenames are specified, stdin is read.  If filenames are
     specified, each file is read in turn.  If a filename is specified
     as a single minus sign (-) stdin is read at that point.  In order
     to read a file whose name really is a minus sign, it should be
     specified on the command line as ``./-''.

EXIT STATUS

     0    All input files were read successfully.

     1    Error(s) occurred and message(s) was printed to stderr.
