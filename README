CMPS 12B/M Data Strucutres

bigint: An arbitrary precision integer calculator implemented in C
  Implements an array stack to store integer digits

bitree_calc: An RPN calculator implemented in Java.
  Uses binary trees to represent and compute RPN expressions

cmatch: searches files for lines matching a user defined string.

crpn: A C implementation of an RPN calculator (using a stack)

jxref: A cross-referecning utility
  Impliments a singly-linked list to store and cross-reference files by line

l8stat: Displays file statistics using C system calls.

lsort / nsort: sorts strings or lines respectively from stdin

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Teaches students to implement common data structures and the algorithms associated with each data structure,
through progressively difficult exercises.
Topics include big "O" notation; pointers, recursion (induction), and dynamic allocation; linked lists
and list processing; stacks, queues, binary trees and binary search trees;
simple sorting techniques and simple search techniques.
Students will gain a working knowledge of the elements of the Java and C programming languages.
Prior experience with Unix is assumed.
