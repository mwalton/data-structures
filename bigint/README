NAME
       mydc - an arbitrary precision calculator

SYNOPSIS
       mydc [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Mydc  is a reverse-polish desk calculator which supports unlimited preci-
       sion arithmetic.    Normally  mydc  reads  from the standard input; 
       if any command arguments aregiven to it, they are filenames, and dc 
       reads and executes the contents of  the files before reading from 
       standard input.  All normal output is to standard output; all error 
       output is to standard error.

       A reverse-polish calculator stores numbers on a stack.  Entering a num-
       ber  pushes  it  on the stack.  Arithmetic operations pop arguments off
       the stack and push the results.

       To enter a number in dc, type  the  digits  with  an  optional  decimal
       point.   Exponential  notation  is  not supported.  To enter a negative
       number, begin the number with ``_''.  ``-'' cannot be used for this, as
       it  is a binary operator for subtraction instead.  To enter two numbers
       in succession, separate them with spaces or newlines.
